title: 360° Camera
description: "For our [LV2](/rockets/#lv22) rocket we envisioned a full, wrap-around camera device that would let you replay video from the launch that would look like you were flying on the rocket!"

In order to do this we needed to put together enough small cameras with a very wide field-of-view. We chose the popular GoPro cameras because of their availability and performance.

The next problem was how to get them in the rocket. LV2 has a modular design, so we only needed to make a new module that had the same interface as the rest of the rocket, then it could be bolted into place wherever we needed. We 3D printed an armature that would hold each camera in place and machined an aluminum tube to fit the rocket and hold the camera mount.

### Solidworks CAD Drawings

Solidworks drawings of the module can be found, along with CAD of our entire rocket in the LV2.3 Soldiworks CAD git repository on GitHub:

## Video From Launch-12

[Launch-12](/launches/#L12) was our most successful LV2 flight for camera footage. Here is the 360 footage in an interactive view:

Look around! Youtube should allow you to move the camera view while the video plays. Look up, look down, focus on the ground, or out to the horizon. Did you see the nosecone come off at the apogee of the flight?

And here is the view stitched together without the "Virtual Reality" view, just the raw footage:
