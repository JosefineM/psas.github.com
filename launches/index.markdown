# Launches

## **L-0** &mdash; June 7<sup>th</sup>, 1998

Four Members of AESS, Andrew, Bjorn, Brian, and Glenn drove to Monroe, WA to
launch the club's first rocket and payload package.

#### Data:

 Rocket   | [LV0](/rockets/#lv0)
 Mass     | 5.53 kg
 Motor    | ?
 Altitude | 0.36 km
 Result   | Success! Rocket and some data were successfully recovered.


Overall the flight was successful. There were a few things that went wrong.
The flight could have been more stable. We believe the instability was do to
using a modified kit rocket. The fins should have been scaled up somewhat to
allow more control surface. They were too small for the low airspeed we had.
The low airspeed was due to a very heavy 5.5 kg vehicle. Another problem was
our acceleration data from the PIC microcontroller sent down over the audio
channel was not frequency shifted at all. Upon later inspection we found a two
wires that had become shorted together. These problems will be fixed for the
next flight

The video feed worked great, with the exception of a couple of frames of snow,
the entire flight was captured at the ground station. The launch site,
surrounding countryside, and approaching thunderstorm could all be seen
clearly.
