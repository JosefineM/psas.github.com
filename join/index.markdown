We need your help! PSAS is an all volunteer group, and there's tons to do. So much, that we can't even list them here! We need everyone, from warm bodies who can help with small tasks, to retired engineers wanting to help mentor the next generation of engineers... even to people who want to try their hand at managing volunteer groups and dealing with logistics! 

Getting involved is simple! Choose one:

1. If all you want to do is follow along with what we're doing, then follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pdxaerospace) or subscribe to our ["Announcements" email list](http://lists.psas.pdx.edu/mailman/listinfo/psas-announce).
2. If you want to get involved but you're not local, then [contact us](/about) and we'll get you into our meetings via Google Hangout.
3. Come to a meeting!! 

## Come to a meeting!

The best way to get involved is to just show up. Talk to anyone in the meeting, and we'll steer you towards the right person to chat with. We're a super friendly group, and there are tons of interesting projects to jump into.

We meet almost every Tuesday night at 7:00pm at Portland State University. To get details -- directions, etc -- click on a meeting in Calendar below.

We have a big introduction meeting at the start of each quarter (the next one should be listed in our schedule below). These intro meetings are great place to start -- we'll give you an overview of the group, our goals, and help you figure out where you can fit in!
