**PSAS** is a student aerospace engineering project at
[Portland State University](http://www.pdx.edu/).
We're building ultra-low-cost, open source rockets that feature some of the
most sophisticated amateur rocket avionics systems in the world.

## Our main project site: [psas.pdx.edu](http://psas.pdx.edu/)

## All code and resources: [github.com/psas](https://github.com/psas)
